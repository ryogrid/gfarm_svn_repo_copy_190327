Gfarm2fs Installation Note
==========================

This distribution is fully tested on Linux.

To build the Gfarm2fs, the Gfarm File System version 2.4.2 or later
and the FUSE file system in userspace are required.  To enable the
extended ACL feature, libacl is required.  Regarding RPM packages and
Debian packages for them, see required package section below.

The following is the installation procedure for the Gfarm2fs.

	% ./configure [options]
	% make
	% sudo make install

Options for the configure:

  --with-gfarm=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for the Gfarm version 2.  When
  this option is not specified, /usr is assumed.

  --prefix=directory

  Specifies a destination directory for installation.  The default is
  /usr/local directory.  This is optional.

When you need to specify a compiler program explicitly, use the
environment variable, CC.  This is an example using gcc.

	% env CC=gcc ./configure [options]
