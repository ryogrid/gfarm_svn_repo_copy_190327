Gfarm2fs Installation Note
==========================

This distribution is fully tested on Linux.  To build the Gfarm2fs,
the Gfarm version 2 is required to be installed.

The following is the installation procedure for the Gfarm2fs.

	% ./configure [options]
	% make
	% sudo make install

Options for the configure:

  --with-gfarm=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for the Gfarm version 2.  When
  this option is not specified, /usr is assumed.


  --prefix=directory

  Specifies a destination directory for installation.  The default is
  /usr/local directory.  This is optional.

When you need to specify a compiler program explicitly, use the
environment variable, CC.  This is an example using gcc.

	% env CC=gcc ./configure [options]
