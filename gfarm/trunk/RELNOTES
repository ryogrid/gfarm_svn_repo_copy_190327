        just after a PostgreSQL server is restarted.
      o fix a bug that gfarm_pgsql_terminate() does not close the
        connection.

  - configure - use autoconf-2.59 instead of 2.60 to suppress
                harmless WARNING messages.

  - Syscall hooking library
      o remove redefinition of "offsetof," which is exposed in
        glibc-2.3.1 in Fedora Core 6.

	replica automatically.
      o when a connection error to gfsd is observed, remove the host
	entry from a scheduling cache.
      o when opening a file with the O_TRUNK flag, schedule a

              handler.

  - libgfarm

       fragment information.
     o fix a serious bug in scheduling which may cause libgfarm to

Updated Features

  * libgfarm

  - improve the functionality of connection cache for gfsd to tolerate

    the number of cached connections is managed by the
    'gfsd_connection_cache' directive in gfarm.conf (default is 16).

  - add definition of gfarm_error_t and GFARM_ERR_NO_ERROR, and
    gfarm_error_string(3) function.

  - support the PostgreSQL 7.4 as a metadata server.

  - show usage with "--help" option.

  - gfsd(8) - fix disk space calculation on FFS on *BSDs.

Unsupported Features

 * NetBSD 1.6.2 is not supported anymore.

Release note for Gfarm 1.3
==========================

[2006.6.6]

Compatibility Note

 * libgfarm uses new protocols for gfsd.  If client library is updated
   to the version 1.3, gfsd needs to be updated to the version 1.3 and
   restarted.

New Features

 * Solaris 9 and 10 syscall hooking support.

 * AIX 5.2 partial support.  AIX 5.2 is now supported except
   libgfs_hook.so syscall hooking library.  It is needed to specify
   --without-gfshook in configure.

 * gfarm_agent(1) - a cluster-wide metadata cache server.  It has new
   functionality to share metadata cache among several PC nodes.

 * config-agent(1) - new configuration script to set up gfarm_agent
   metadata cache server.  For details, refer to INSTALL.RPM document.

 * gfdump(1) - new metadata dump and restore tool;
	% gfdump -d -f dumpfile   to dump metadata
	% gfdump -r -f dumpfile   to restore metadata
   Note that host information is dumped by gfhost not by gfdump.

 * gfs_statfsnode(3) and gfs_statfsnode_cached(3) - new functions to
   acquire free disk space

 * Environment variable

 - GFARM_WRITE_TARGET_DOMAIN environment variable specifies the domain
   name that has priority for new files to be created.

 - GFARM_WRITE_LOCAL_PRIORITY environment variable changes policy
   where a new file is created on a file system node.  By default,
   local storage is always selected if enough disk space is available.
   On the other hand, if 0 or 'disable' is set to the environment
   variable, local storage is not always selected for better load
   balancing and disk capacity control.

 * gfarm.conf - Gfarm configuration file

 - minimum_free_disk_space directive specifies the minimum free disk
   space for file system node scheduling.  Any file system node with
   less free space than specified has low priority in selection.  The
   default size is 128 MBytes.

 - write_local_priority directive changes policy where a new file is
   created on a file system node.  See the description of
   GFARM_WRITE_LOCAL_PRIORITY environment variable above.

 - agent_serverhost and agent_serverport directives specify a
   gfarm_agent metadata cache server.

 - several directives for cache management.

Updated Features

 * gfreg(1) - the -H and -D options can be specified in all modes

 * configure - the --without-gfshook option is added to disable to
   build syscall hooking library

 * gfsd(8) - multiple spool directories support by running multiple
   gfsds with a different virtual IP address on the same server host.
   Sanity check is added to detect input/output error.

 * libgfarm - add access control for gfs_chdir, gfs_opendir,
   gfs_unlink, gfs_unlink_section, gfs_unlink_section_replica, and
   gfs_rename.

 * gfs_fstat(3) - return current file size in section mode.

 * Performance Improvement

 - config-gfarm(1) - use autovacuum functionality for PostgreSQL
   backend if supported.

 - do not re-calculate checksum at close time in any case.

 - implement new scheduling algorithm which uses RTT (Round Trip Time)
   and disk free space to make it possible to select near file
   replicas and near file system nodes and to avoid disk full.

 - reduce memory consumption when using a PostgreSQL backend.

 * Robustness Improvement

 - try to re-connect when the connection to a gfarm_agent server is
   broken due to rebooting or some other reason.

 - set 5 second timeout in connect() to avoid slow response in
   unstable lossy networks.

 * Bug fix

 - gfs_pio_create(3) and gfs_mkdir(3) can create a file or a directory
   with invalid mode.

 - gfls(1) - fix a segmentation fault problem.

 - ctime is not updated.

 - libgfarm (metadb_pgsql.c) - fix memory leak.

 - gfs_chmod(3) - fix a 'chmod +x' bug in OpenLDAP backend.

    server is broken due to rebooting or some other reason.

Release note for Gfarm 1.0.3
============================

[2004.5.25]

Updated Features

 * Added new I/O functions; gfs_mkdir, gfs_rmdir, gfs_pio_gets,
     gfs_pio_readline, gfs_pio_readdelim.

 * gfrmdir - it terminates very quickly. (Bugzilla-ja #20)

 * gfstat - it also displays the information of assumed fragment
     number. (Bugzilla-ja #16)

 * gfexec - The way to pass node number and other information to a
     gfarm process is changed again to be able to be inherited by any
     child process.  This has a side effect that all gfarm
     applications need to be re-compiled.

     '-s', '-I', '-N' options are added.

 * Bug fix

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Fixed a segfault problem especially when using syscall hooking
     library.

   - Fixed a segfault bug in gfs_pio_fileno(). (Bugzilla-ja #25)

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Fixed a bug such that select() results in timeout when checking
     readability of a file descriptor for a remote Gfarm file.

   - Fixed a bug such that a parallel process cannot be executed
     correctly, which was introduced in the version 1.0.2.

   - Fixed a bug when hooking fstat().

Release note for Gfarm 1.0.2
============================

[2004.4.15]

Updated Features

 * Added a new client command; gfwhoami --- prints effective user
   name.

 * Supported OpenLDAP-2.1.X or later (LDAPv3).

 * Supported special characters; ' ', ',', '+', '"', '\', '<', '>',
   and ';' in file names. (bugzilla-ja #13)

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   - Added system call hook entries for directory operations;
     dgetents, dgetents64, open, open64, close, stat, fstat, chdir,
     fchdir, getpwd, and access.

   - Modified semantics of '/gfarm:'.  It is considered to be the root
     directory in Gfarm file system instead of a current working
     directory.  Applications do not assume '/gfarm:' indicates a
     current working directory in Gfarm file system.

   - Changed the way to pass node number and other information to
     a gfarm process, when 'gfexec' command is used.
     *** You do not need to modify application source codes any more ***
     *** to utilize Gfarm file system.  Just link with gfs_hook.o.   ***

     This has a side effect that all gfarm applications need to be
     re-compiled. Or, you may be able to use "-S" option of "gfrun"
     command, if you cannot recompile gfarm applications.

 * Bug fix

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Fixed a bug such that gfs_pio_set_view_*() occasionally returns
     the error message "Success" even when opening a file fails.

   - Fixed a bug of default file view. (Bugzilla #4)

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Plugged memory leak.
