=======================================
Gfarm installation from the source code
=======================================

This distribution is fully tested on Linux.  The building tests were done
on NetBSD, and Solaris.

This section describes how to build Gfarm binaries from the source
distribution.  You can skip this document if you use a binary
distribution.

To build the Gfarm system, the OpenSSL library and either the OpenLDAP
library, or the PostgreSQL library are required.  To utilize the Grid Security
Infrastructure (GSI) as the authentication method, the GSSAPI library is
needed.  Currently, the GSSAPI library provided by the Globus toolkit
version 2, 3, and 4 (GT2, GT3, and GT4) is supported by the
configuration.  When building a gfs_hook_mpi.o syscall-hook library for
executing legacy MPI applications on the Gfarm filesystem, and when
building sample MPI applications in this distribution, an MPI library
is needed.

The following is the installation procedure for the Gfarm system.
Please use GNU make on operating systems other than Linux and NetBSD.

	% ./configure [options]
	% make
	% su
	Password:
	# make install

Options for configure:

  --with-openldap=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for OpenLDAP.  When this
  option is not specified, the installation directory is searched for
  automatically.


  --with-postgresql=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for PostgreSQL.  When this
  option is not specified, the installation directory is searched for
  automatically.


  --with-openssl=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for OpenSSL.  The default
  directory is /usr.


  --with-mpi=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for MPI to build sample MPI
  applications and a syscall-hook library for MPI applications.  If
  the directory is specified, ${directory}/bin/mpicc is used to
  compile MPI applications.  Otherwise, mpicc is used.  This is
  optional.


  --with-globus=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for the Globus Toolkit to utilize the
  GSI authentication  method.  When a directory is not specified, the
  environment variable, GLOBUS_LOCATION is used.  This is optional.
  The flavor of the Globus library is searched for automatically.
  If you need to specify a flavor, specify it with the
  --with-globus-flavor=flavor option.


  --without-gfshook

  Disables building of a syscall-hook library, such as gfs_hook.o or
  libgfs_hook.so.  It is needed for AIX, on which the syscall-hook library
  is not supported.


  --prefix=directory

  Specifies a destination directory for installation.  The default is
  /usr/local directory.  This is optional.


  --sysconfdir=directory

  Specifies a directory where the ``gfarm.conf'' configuration file is
  located.  The default is the ``etc'' directory under the directory
  specified in the above --prefix option.  This document assumes
  that --sysconfdir=/etc is specified.  This is optional.

When you need to specify a compiler program explicitly, use the
environment variable, CC.  This is an example using gcc.

	% env CC=gcc ./configure [options]

======
Notice
======

- On FreeBSD, if either gsi or gsi_auth is selected as the authentication
  method, and if Gfarm is linked with OpenLDAP in ports system,
  a segmentation fault happens in OpenSSL library, and Gfarm programs
  dump core.  Thus, if you will use gsi or gsi_auth method,
  you have to specify "--without-openldap" in the configure option,
  and have to use PostgreSQL to store the Gfarm metadata.
  The cause of this is probably because OpenSSL library included in Globus
  conflicts with OpenSSL library in ports, due to their version mismatch.
