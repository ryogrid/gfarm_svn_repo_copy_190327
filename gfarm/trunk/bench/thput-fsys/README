File I/O bandwidth benchmark - thput-fsys and thput-mpi

*** What are thput-fsys and thput-mpi?

thput-fsys measures file I/O bandwidth for sequential
writing, sequential reading, and file copying.  File
size to be measured, and block size for each write(2)
and read(2) operation can be specified by the command-
line options '-s' and '-b', respectively.

thput-mpi measures parallel file I/O bandwidth for
sequential writing, sequential reading, and file
copying of a different file in a shared file system or
each separate file system.

*** How to install

% ./configure
% make
% make install

thput-fsys [ -s filesize ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -wrcp ] [ file1 [ file2 ]]

Options:
	-s	specify a file size in MByte to be measured
	-b	specify a block size in byte for each write(2) and read(2)
	-w	write test
	-r	read test
	-c	copy test
	-p	preserve a file that write test creates

thput-fsys measures file I/O bandwidth by creating 'file1', by
reading 'file1', and by copying 'file1' to 'file2'.  The default
filenames for 'file1' and 'file2' are test.file1 and test.file2,
respectively.  If you do not specify the filenames, file I/O
bandwidth of the file system in the current working directory is
measured.  A read test and a copy test require a write test, or
an existing file 'file1'.  Files generated by thput-fsys will be
removed unless the -p option is specified.

Example:

	// 10GB file, 64K block size in current working directory
	% thput-fsys -rw -b 65536 -s 10240	

	// 10GB file, 64K block size in /tmp
	% thput-fsys -rw -b 65536 -s 10240 /tmp/file

*** Manual page for thput-mpi

thput-mpi [ -s filesize ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -rc ] [ -v ] [ file1 [ file2 ]]

Options:
	-s	specify a file size in MByte to be measured
	-b	specify a block size in byte for each write(2) and read(2)
	-r	do read test also
	-c	do copy test also
	-v	report bandwidth of each process

thput-mpi measures parallel file I/O bandwidth for
sequential writing, sequential reading, and file
copying of a different file in a shared file system or
each separate file system.

thput-mpi measures parallel file I/O bandwidth by creating
'file1.$$', by reading 'file1.$$', and by copying 'file1.$$'
to 'file2.$$'.  '$$' will be replaced with the node rank.  The
default filenames for 'file1' and 'file2' are test.file1 and
test.file2, respectively.  If you would like to measure the
parallel file I/O bandwidth in a specific file system, you
may need to specify full path names for 'file1' and/or 'file2'.

Example:

	// 10GB*4 file, 64K block size in current working directory
	% mpiexec -np 4 thput-mpi -rw -b 65536 -s 10240	

	// 10GB*4 file, 64K block size in /tmp (of each node)
	% mpiexec -np 4 thput-mpi -rw -b 65536 -s 10240 /tmp/file
