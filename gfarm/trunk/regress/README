TO RUN TEST

1. run "make check" under the following conditions:
  - on a filesystem node,	with	gfarm_agent
  - on a client host,		with	gfarm_agent
  - on a filesystem node,	without	gfarm_agent
  - on a client host,		without	gfarm_agent

TO WRITE TEST
- each test should be independent from other test.
i.e.
- each test shouldn't assume the order of the tests.
- each test should clear the changes made by the test before exiting.
