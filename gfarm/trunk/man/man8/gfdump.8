.SH NAME
gfdump(8) \- Dump and restore Gfarm file system metadata
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfdump\fR \fB-d\fR [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB-f \fIfilename\fB\fR ]


\fBgfdump\fR \fB-r\fR [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB-f \fIfilename\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfdump\fR dumps or restores Gfarm file system
metadata including directory information, file information, and
replica copy information.
.PP
\fBgfdump\fR does not dump and restore file system
node information in Gfarm metadata.  That is why \fBgfhost
-M\fR and \fBgfhost -R\fR are required to dump and
restore the complete file system metadata in Gfarm file system,
respectively.
.PP
Note that \fBgfdump\fR accesses to the Gfarm
metadata server directly regardless of setting of a Gfarm metadata
cache server, it is needed to be executed on a client host that can
access to the Gfarm metadata server.
