gfarm-devel package or put the gfarm source code to include directory.

- Preparing samba header files
Move to samba source code directory and run "configure.developer" script.
Then, type "make."  "make install" is not necessary at this time.

$ ./configure.developer
$ su 
# make

-----
$ ./configure --with-samba-source=SAMBA_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
$ make

Next, copy gfarm_vfs.so to samba vfs directory as a super user.
(The directory is "/usr/lib64/samba/vfs" in RHEL5 x86_64.)

# cp gfarm_vfs.so SAMBA_VFS_DIRECTORY

Add following settings to smb.conf:
-----
[gfarm]
        comment = Gfarm FS
        path = /
        vfs objects = gfarm_vfs
        writeable = yes
        browseable = yes
