GfarmFS-FUSE - ChangeLog

[2007.03.16] Version 2.0

New Features

  * add -N and -D options for asynchronous file replication.
  * add --errlog and --syslog options.
  * add Test Suites (make check) for operations test.
  * get rid of limitation in use of -a option.
  * gfarmfs-exec.sh, mount.gfarmfs and umount.gfarmfs are installed by
   `make install'.

Documentation

  * README: add examples of mounting gfarmfs.

Bug fix

  * fix a bug such that `umask' is not effective on gfarmfs.
  * fix a bug such that write(2) cannot write anymore after read(2)
    gets EOF.
  * If filesystem nodes are added or removed, statfs(2) can calculate
    exactly.
  * fix a bug such that f_frsize is not set.

[2006.10.12] Version 1.3

New Features

  * add FUSE 2.5 compatible mode. (auto configuration by ./configure)
    This mode can work correctly for open(2), creat(2), access(2),
    fgetattr(2), ftruncate(2).
    In this mode, fastcreate behavior was not necessary anymore.
  * support statfs(2).
  * add -S and --disable-statfs options.
  * add -b and --buffered options.
  * add -F and --exactfilesize options.
  * add -n and --dirnlink options.
  * add --trace option.
  * add KNOWN_PROBLEMS in README.

Update Features

  * Each short option can be one string. (ex. -lsu)
  * do not count nlink of a directory by default setting.
    (default is 32000.)
    (Enables to count nlink of a directory by -d option)
  * remove -f and --fastcreate options.
    (fastcreate behavior is always selected on FUSE 2.4 or earlier.)
  * In the case of "file section" is one, the file will be opened in the
    index view. 
  * By default, do not use I/O buffer.  So, I/O performance is worse
    than the previous version.  By specifying the -b option so that
    I/O buffer is used, I/O performance will be the same as the
    previous version.  (I/O buffer is useful especially in remote
    access.)
  * When a file is not readable, hard link emulation will work
    if possible.

Avoid limitations of libgfarm

  * stat(2) can return an exact st_size in the process of open(2)
    on the same gfarmfs client.
  * Using -F option, stat(2) can return an exact st_size while
    open(2) is being processed on another gfarmfs client.
  * utime(2) and chmod(2) will work in the process of open(2) on
    the same gfarmfs client.
  * rename(2) and chmod(2) do not destroy metadata in the process
    of open(2) on the same gfarmfs client.

Bug fix

  * keep mtime and atime at hard link emulation.
  * fixed a bug such that gfs_pio_create() can create an invalid FIFO
    descriptor.
  * fixed a bug such that chown(2) for a symlink entry becomes ENOENT.
