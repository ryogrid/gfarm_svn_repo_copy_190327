*** GfarmFS-FUSE

GfarmFS-FUSE enables you to mount a Gfarm filesystem in userspace.

  Gfarm:
      http://datafarm.apgrid.org/

  FUSE:
      http://fuse.sourceforge.net/


*** Installation

To build GfarmFS-FUSE, development packages of Gfarm version 1.1.1 (or
later) and FUSE version 2.2 (or later) are required.

Installation steps of GfarmFS-FUSE:

    $ ./configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

Options for configure:

  --prefix=<directory>

  specifies a destination directory for installation.  The 'gfarmfs'
  command is installed in 'directory'/bin.  Default is /usr/local.

If Gfarm and/or FUSE are installed to a nonstandard location, you may
need to specify the location by CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
variables in configure.  In the case of sh or bash,

    $ CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R,/usr/local/lib' ./configure

In the case of csh or tcsh,

    $ env CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R,/usr/local/lib' ./configure


*** Mount

Make sure your Gfarm environment is set. (see INSTALL.en of Gfarm)

Run the 'gfarmfs' command as a normal user to mount a Gfarm
filesystem:

    $ gfarmfs [GfarmFS options] <mountpoint> [FUSE options]

<mountpoint> needs to be a directory where a user can access in read
and write mode.  By default, other users than a user that mounts a
Gfarm file system cannot access files or directories under the mount
point.  'gfarmfs' is executed in a single thread by specifying the
'-s' FUSE option.  For other FUSE options, refer to README included in
FUSE package.

GfarmFS options:

  -a <architecture>

  specifies the architecture name of the client host.

  In Gfarm file system, the architecture name is required to access
  files that has execution bits since they may have multiple binaries
  for each different architecture.  When the client host is a file
  system node, the architecture is automatically determined by the
  Gfarm metadata database.  Otherwise, you need to specify the client
  architecture explicitly to access files that has execution bits.
  <architecture> is typically a canonical system name like
  sparc-sun-solaris8. (see man gfhost)

  Since Gfarm version 1.2 or later, the 'client_architecture'
  directive in the configuration file or the environment variable
  GFARM_ARCHITECTURE can also specify the architecture name of the
  client host. (see man gfarm.conf)

  -s, --symlink

  enables symlink(2) emulation.  With this option, a symbolic link is
  emulated using an invisible file whose suffix is '.gfarmfs-symlink'
  to manage the target path.  You can use this option until Gfarm does
  support it.

  -l, --linkiscopy

  enables link(2) emulation.  With this option, link(2) is emulated by
  copying a target file instead of creating a hardlink.  You can use
  this option until Gfarm does support it.

  -u, --unlinkall

  With this option, unlink(2) removes all binaries for different
  architectures of the specified file that has execution bits.  This
  was the default feature of GfarmFS-FUSE version 1.0.

  Since GfarmFS-FUSE version 1.1, unlink(2) removes just a binary that
  corresponds to the client architecture of the specified file that
  has execution bits, which is the same behavior as the Gfarm syscall
  hooking library since Gfarm version 1.2.


*** Unmount

Run the 'fusermount' command (see README of FUSE):

    $ fusermount -u <mountpoint>
