*** GfarmFS-FUSE

GfarmFS-FUSE enables you to mount a Gfarm filesystem in userspace.

  Gfarm:
      http://datafarm.apgrid.org/

  FUSE:
      http://fuse.sourceforge.net/


*** Installation

To build GfarmFS-FUSE, development packages of Gfarm version 1.1.1 (or
later) and FUSE version 2.2 (or later) are required.

Installation steps of GfarmFS-FUSE:

    $ ./configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

Options for configure:

  --prefix=<directory>

  specifies a destination directory for installation.  The 'gfarmfs'
  command is installed in 'directory'/bin.  Default is /usr/local.

If Gfarm and/or FUSE are installed to a nonstandard location, you may
need to specify the location by CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
variables in configure.  In the case of sh or bash,

    $ CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R,/usr/local/lib' ./configure

In the case of csh or tcsh,

    $ env CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R,/usr/local/lib' ./configure


*** Mount

Make sure your Gfarm environment is set. (see INSTALL.en of Gfarm)

Run the 'gfarmfs' command as a normal user to mount a Gfarm
filesystem:

    $ gfarmfs [GfarmFS options] <mountpoint> [FUSE options]

<mountpoint> needs to be a directory where a user can access in read
and write mode.  By default, other users than a user that mounts a
Gfarm file system cannot access files or directories under the mount
point.  'gfarmfs' is executed in a single thread by specifying the
'-s' FUSE option.  For other FUSE options, refer to README included in
FUSE package.

GfarmFS options:

  -a <architecture>

  specifies the architecture name of the client host.  You cannot
  access files that has execution bits without this option when your
  client host is not registered in Gfarm metadata server (or your
  client host is not a file system node).  <architecture> is typically
  a canonical system name like sparc-sun-solaris8. (see man gfhost)

  -s, --symlink

  enables symlink(2) to work even though Gfarm file system does not
  support it.  With this option, a symbolic link is emulated using an
  invisible file whose suffix is '.gfarmfs-symlink' to manage the
  target path.  Note that Gfarm version 1.1.1 does not support it.

  -l, --linkiscopy

  enables link(2) to work even though Gfarm file system does not
  support it.  With this option, link(2) is emulated by copies a
  target file instead of creating a hardlink.  Note that Gfarm version
  1.1.1 does not support it.


*** Unmount

Run the 'fusermount' command (see README of FUSE):

    $ fusermount -u <mountpoint>
